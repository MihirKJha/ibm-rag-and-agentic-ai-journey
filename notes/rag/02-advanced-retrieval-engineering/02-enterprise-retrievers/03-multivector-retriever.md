# 03. MultiVector Retriever

> **Category:** Enterprise Retrievers
> **Module:** Advanced Retrieval Engineering
> **Prerequisites:** VectorStore Retriever, Parent Document Retriever, Embeddings, RAG Pipeline
> **Difficulty:** Advanced

> **Note:** MultiVector Retriever is an advanced retrieval technique that represents a single document using multiple vector embeddings instead of a single embedding. By indexing multiple semantic representations—such as summaries, parent-child chunks, titles, or hypothetical questions—it significantly improves retrieval accuracy while preserving access to the original source document. This technique is widely used in enterprise Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve semantic coverage and document recall.

# Overview

Traditional vector retrieval represents each document using a single embedding. While effective for many use cases, a single embedding often fails to capture all the important semantic aspects of complex documents.

For example, a technical document may contain:

- High-level concepts
- Detailed implementation steps
- API references
- Configuration examples
- Frequently asked questions

A single embedding cannot accurately represent every aspect of such content.

The **MultiVector Retriever** addresses this limitation by generating multiple embeddings for different representations of the same document. During retrieval, the system searches across all vectors but ultimately returns the original parent document or associated content.

Unlike traditional retrievers that maintain a one-to-one relationship between documents and embeddings, MultiVector Retriever supports a one-to-many relationship, allowing multiple semantic views of the same document.

This approach is particularly valuable for enterprise knowledge bases, technical documentation, legal documents, research papers, and large manuals where different users may search using different terminology.

# How MultiVector Retriever Works

1. Split or transform a document into multiple semantic representations.
2. Generate an embedding for each representation.
3. Store all embeddings with references to the same parent document.
4. Perform similarity search across every embedding.
5. Identify the highest-scoring representation.
6. Retrieve the corresponding parent document.
7. Pass the retrieved content to the LLM.

This architecture improves retrieval by allowing different semantic views of the same document to participate in the search process.
